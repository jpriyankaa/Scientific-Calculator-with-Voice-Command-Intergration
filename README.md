Scientific Calculator with Voice Recognition

- This project is a comprehensive scientific calculator application built using Python's Tkinter library for the GUI, along with additional libraries such as math, pygame for sound, and speech_recognition for voice commands. The calculator supports a wide range of mathematical operations and can be operated both manually through the GUI and via voice commands for hands-free convenience.

Features:

- Basic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus.
- Scientific Functions:
- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, sinh, cosh, tanh).
- Square root and cube root.
- Exponentiation and logarithmic functions (ln, log10).
- Factorial, degrees, and radians conversion.
- Pi (Ï€) and Euler's number (e).

Voice Recognition:

- Voice commands for performing operations.
- Integration with Google Speech Recognition API.
- Graphical User Interface:
- Clean and interactive GUI built with Tkinter.
- Visual feedback and results display.
- Buttons for various operations and functions.
- Microphone button for activating voice commands.

Installation:
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine along with the required libraries.

- Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scientific-calculator.git
cd scientific-calculator

- Install the required libraries:
pip install pygame speechrecognition

- Download the necessary audio files:
Ensure that you have music1.mp3 and music2.mp3 in the project directory. These files are used for audio feedback.

- Run the application:
python calculator.py

Usage:

1.Manual Operation:

- Launch the application: Open the terminal and run python calculator.py.
- Enter expressions: Use the GUI buttons to input mathematical expressions.
- Get results: Click the = button to evaluate and display results.

2. Voice Command Operation:

- Activate the microphone: Click the microphone button in the GUI.
- Speak commands: Use natural language to input expressions (e.g., "What is the sum of 5 and 3?").
- Receive feedback: The result will be displayed in the entry field after processing the voice command.

Voice Commands:

The calculator can recognize and execute a variety of commands, including but not limited to:
- Basic operations: "Add", "Subtract", "Multiply", "Divide".
- Trigonometric functions: "sin", "cos", "tan".
- Special functions: "Factorial", "Logarithm", "Square root".
- Constants: "Pi", "Euler's number".
  
Example Commands:

1. "What is the Addition of 10 and 5?"
2. "Calculate 25 divided by 5"
3. "What is the Subtraction of 97 and 27?"
